After researching and learning that Kaua‚Äôi was home to some of the world‚Äôs most sought after hiking trails, and seeing photos of the [lush scenery of the island], this [TODO: Note the size] island seemed to be an ideal place to run, hike and explore for one week.</p><h3 id="flights">Flights</h3><p>Upon completing my undergraduate degree in 2018, I moved to Seattle for my first full time job. My boyfriend, IYJ, was working in San Francisco at the time, so we knew we would be flying back and forth to visit each other every month.¬†Alaska Airlines, which is [TODO: find a synonym for ‚Äúbased‚Äù] based in Seattle, was offering 30,000 bonus miles at the time for signing up for their Visa card, so I signed up for the program. The Alaska Visa card comes with an additional perk called the ‚ÄúAlaska Companion Fare‚Äù which allowed us to purchase one round trip ticket to Lihue, Kaua‚Äôi and receive the second ticket for just the cost of taxes and fees. So although there is a $75 annual fee, the companion fare ticket alone makes the card worth the cost. We bought our flight tickets in [TODO: insert the date we bought the tickets], and it is typically recommended to purchase tickets [x] months in advance.¬†</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-2.jpg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h4 id="rent-a-car">Rent a car</h4><p>Definitely rent a car if you‚Äôre planning a trip to Kaua‚Äôi. It is important to note that the highway [TODO: Highway Name] that goes around the island does not connect between the North and West shores. [TODO: Check the proper spelling]Four-wheel-drive is great if you plan to go offroading, or go on unpaved roads to get closer to certain less-trafficked trailheads, but for IYJ and I, the economical Nissan Altima that we rented sufficed.</p><h4 id="little-blue-book">Little Blue Book</h4><p>For me, typical trip planning consists of asking for recommendations from friends, looking at their itineraries, and searching the internet for things to do and places to see. But one day when browsing at Barnes and Noble, I came across [TODO: Affiliate advertisement] The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook and decided to give it a try - and I am very glad that I did. This little blue book was the most important resource for planning my trip and I referred to its maps and trail directions during the duration our stay. Packed with all the information I needed, from detailed directions for hikes to more challenging adventures, to reviews on restaurants. The popularity of this book became apparent to me once I heard travelers en-route to Lihue (the main airport? TODO: confirm) reading the pages aloud, and seeing tourists with the book in hand on the trails.</p><h4 id="where-we-stayed">Where we stayed</h4><p>-Grand Hayatt We spent our first two nights on the island at the Grand Hayatt in [TODO: insert location]. Many travel guides including the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook suggest that it is the best hotel on the South Shore and even the whole island. (Plus there is a special discount if you run the Kauai Marathon or Half Marathon. I recently saw that rooms were going for $231 a night using the discount code provided by the Marathon organizers). We spent the first day exploring the hotels [x] pools (including 1 saltwater pool), waterslide, private beach, and adjacent [TODO: find the correct spelling of the name] Po‚Äôipu Bay Golf Course (more in the next section). For dinner we made a reservation at Tidepools, which was pricy but good. The second day we didn‚Äôt utilize the hotel amenities since we were both exhausted after running the half-marathon. [TODO: insert photos] -ISO Hotel There was no air conditioning here so we were suffering during the first night of our stay. We also saw a giant spider hanging out on our car here which provided quite a shock (not the hotel‚Äôs fault of course). The complimentary breakfast here was also not particulalary good, so I would recommend walking across the street to get some Mickey D‚Äôs instead. -Wyndham We rented this Airbnb for our 2 night stay in North Shore. It had everything we needed, and even had A.C., which I.Y. was very happy about‚Ä¶ -Camping in¬†Ko‚Äôkee We camped a total of two nights here. On the first night the clouds looked ominous and it started to pour soon after we climbed into our tent that we had set up for the first time. While sheltered from the downpour, the sounds of the rain beating down on the tent were extremely soothing. In the morning we woke up to a rooster who had strolled into our campspot around 6 AM. The second night we camped at Ko‚Äôkee, there were no clouds, and with less light pollution there in the [TODO: say something else instead of mountains] mountains, we were able to admire the stars. Overall, the campsite is easy to get to, and parking is close to the camp areas. The campsite is also a short walk away from Ko‚Äôkee lodge. You‚Äôll need reservations to camp here and while there are restrooms and showers on site, after taking one peek inside the facilities, I decided to squat outside‚Ä¶</p><h4 id="kauai-halfmarathon">Kauai Half¬†Marathon</h4><p>When I decided I wanted to run a half-marathon, I thought choosing a destination half-marathon would allow me to explore a new place as well as accomplish my goal in a beautiful setting. I was deciding between the Kauai Half Marathon and the Maui Half Marathon, but ultimately settled on Kauai since the date of the race fell on Labor Day weekend, which meant I could take one less day off from work. Since the first 7 miles there would be a 1000 ft elevation gain, I trained for it by running up hills in Mt. Tamapalais and Pacifica. All was going well in my training, until I had a minor injury to my foot. That healed in a week, but then I fell off my boosted board on the way to work and strained my calf three weeks leading up to the race. [TODO: Insert the time I ran here]. [TODO: Add more details about during the race]</p><h4 id="golf-at-poipu-bay-golfcourse">Golf at Poipu Bay Golf¬†Course</h4><p>I‚Äôm not a golf player, but IYJ has been playing on and off for most of his life, and he signed us up to do [TODO: put a link to practice and play] practice and play at the Poipu Bay Golf Course right next to the Grand Hayat on our second day on the island. The course was beautiful, and we had the whole practice area and first three holes to ourselves. There was not a single person in sight, and was that especially fine by me since I ended up hitting several over 14s. They even gave some golf bag tag souvenirs with our names printed, which we happily placed on our bookshelf when we got back.</p><h4 id="hikes">Hikes</h4><p>-Pihea Trail The Pihea Trail was the first trail that we tackled. In my opinion, the very beginning of the trail offers the best views out of the entire trail- and the views are amazing. But IYJ and I continued to hike the entire 2.1 miles which consisted of steep steps and lots of mud, which was messy but a lot of fun.</p><p>-Canyon Trail to Ho‚Äôopi Falls We hiked this trail on the same day we hiked the Pihea Trail. It is also in the [TODO: fact check - Ko‚Äôkee state park area]. The trail starts off uneventful for the first few miles, but then we were rewarded with impressive views of the canyon. After appreciating the views of the canyon we continued along to Ho‚Äôopi Falls. At times the ledges we had to cross were questionable. One wrong step could have sent us tumbling down into the canyon, so I really recommend to be extra cautious. Aside from being slightly dangerous if you take a wrong step, I would highly recommend this trail because of the jaw-dropping views of the canyon and a refreshing waterfall at the end. [TODO: Edit this it sounds annoying]¬†</p><p>-Kalalau Trail Revered as one of the best hiking trails in the world, IYJ and I were very disappointed when we found out the reservation rules had changed since we last checked. As of [TODO: Insert the date that the system changed], reservations can be made [TODO: Confirm the number of days 90] days in advance vs the original 2 weeks in advance we had seen on the website. I tried to call the department of [natural land and resources] to ask about if there was any way we could get a permit since the rules had only recently changed, but I was told that there are a lot of changes being made to the reservation systems, and if you really want a permit, you need to check the site everyday to make sure you stay up to date with any changes. While we were quite disappointed, this led us to finding another adventure on the North Shore, which ended up becoming one of the greatest highlights of our trip‚Ää-‚ÄäKayaking the Napali Coast. [TODO: Add that you can hike the first few miles without a permit but that you will need to take a shuttle here].</p><h4 id="kayaking-the-napalicoast">Kayaking the Napali¬†Coast</h4><p>There were so many highlights from our trip, but for me the most memorable experience was kayaking 20 nautical miles on the Napali coast. We decided to do the [Insert the name of the program]. After completing the journey, my advice is that you only sign up for this activity if you are decently fit, are comfortable swimming, do not have severe motion sickness. The first mile of the trip is a trial-run. If you‚Äôre feeling like you might puke up the spam musubi you ate for breakfast to fuel you for the trip, you have the option of stopping there and taking a van ride back to Hanalei. If you‚Äôre still feeling great, you‚Äôre allowed to continue on the 19 miles of rolling waves ahead. It is highly recommended to take motion sickness pills, as the waves can get really choppy, and flipping your kayak is not a difficult event. One woman was celebrating her 40th birthday had taken a motion sickness pill the night before and the morning of the kayak trip, and she still wound up puking out her guts, but she enjoyed the beautiful scenery so much that she continued the trip. You‚Äôll be asking yourself if you are in a dream‚Ä¶ because the views of the Napali coast are surreal. You‚Äôll feel like you are in one the countless movies that were filmed on the island. Some of my favrite parts of the kayaking journey were going into seacaves, under waterfalls, and seeing a turtle swim up to our kayak and poke its head out, and a pack of dophins swimming in the distance, and the powerade blue waters looked surreal.</p><h4 id="helicopter">Helicopter</h4><p>According to the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook, the ultimate way to see Kauai is by helicopter.
